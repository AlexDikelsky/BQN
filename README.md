# BQN: finally, an APL for your flying saucer

*This repository does not yet have a working implementation. However, there are some incomplete implementations you can use, with one you can try online [here](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN2NGN/web/index.html). See [running.md](running.md) for more.*

**BQN** is a new programming language in the APL lineage, which aims to remove inconsistent and burdensome aspects of the APL tradition and put the great ideas on a firmer footing. BQN is aimed at existing and aspiring APL-family programmers, and using it requires a solid understanding of functions and multidimensional arrays. However, because of its focus on providing simple, consistent, and powerful array operations, BQN should also be a good language for learning array programming and building stronger array intuition.

BQN maintains many of the ideas that made APL\360 revolutionary in 1966:
* Human-friendly **infix notation** with no precedence rules to remember.
* **Built-in array operations** handle any number of dimensions easily.
* **Higher-order functions** allow basic functions to be applied in more powerful ways.

It incorporates concepts developed over years of APL practice:
* The **leading axis model**, which allows for simpler built-in functions.
* Trains and combinators for **tacit programming**.
* Lightweight **anonymous functions** (like [dfns](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dfn)).

But BQN is redesigned from the ground up, with brand new ideas to make these paradigms easier to use and less likely to fail.
* The **based array model** makes non-arrays a fundamental part of the language, and removes the surprise of floating arrays and the hassle of explicit boxes. New **array notation** eliminates the gotchas of [stranding](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Strand_notation).
* A [**context-free grammar**](doc/context.md) where a value's syntactic role is determined by its spelling makes it easier for machines and humans to understand code.
* Oh, and it naturally leads to [**first-class functions**](doc/functional.md), a feature often missed in APL.
* The **new symbols** for built-in functionality allow the syntactic role of a primitive to be distinguished at a glance, and aim to be more consistent and intuitive.

## What kind of name is "BQN"?

It's three letters, that happen to match the capitals in "Big Questions Notation". You can pronounce it "bacon", but are advised to avoid this unless there's puns.

## What does BQN look like?

Rather strange, most likely:

    ‚äë+`‚àò‚åΩ‚çü12‚Üï2  # The 12th Fibonacci number

For longer samples, you can [gaze into the abyss](c.bqn) that is the (incomplete) self-hosted compiler, or take a look at the friendlier [markdown processor](doc/md.bqn) used to format and highlight documentation files. There are also [some translations](examples/fifty.bqn) from ["A History of APL in 50 Functions"](https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/) here.

## Array model

Most of BQN's functionality deals with the manipulation of multidimensional arrays. However, it discards many of the complications of traditional APL [array models](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Array_model). Unlike in APL, non-array data is possible, and common: numbers, characters, and functions are not arrays (see the full list of [types](#data-types) below). This avoids some difficulties that show up when trying to treat scalar arrays as the fundamental unit; in particular, there is no "floating" so a value is always different from a scalar array that contains it. This system has been [proposed](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/586656.586663) in APL's past under the name **based array theory**.

Currently, the intention is that arrays will not have prototypes, so that all empty arrays of the same shape behave identically. Different elements of an array should not influence each other. While some APLs force numbers placed in the same array to a common representation, which may have different precision properties, BQN will enforce 64-bit floating-point precision, and only use representations or methods compatible with it (for example, integers up to 32 bits).

## Syntax

BQN syntax consists of expressions where computation is done with a little organizing structure around them like assignment, functions, and list notation. Expressions are where the programmer is in control so the design tries to do as much as possible with them before introducing special syntax.

### Expressions

Like APL, BQN uses four *syntactic roles* for values in expressions:
* **Values**, like APL arrays or J nouns
* **Functions**, or verbs in J
* **Modifiers**, like APL monadic operators or J adverbs
* **Compositions**, like APL dyadic operators or J conjunctions.

These roles work exactly like they do in APL, with functions applying to one or two arguments, modifiers taking a single function or value on the left, and compositions taking a function or value on each side.

Unlike APL, in BQN the syntactic role of a value is determined purely by the way it's spelled: a lowercase first letter (`name`) makes it a value, an uppercase first letter (`Name`) makes it a function, and underscores are used for modifiers (`_name`) and compositions (`_name_`). Below, the function `{ùïéùï©}` treats its left argument `ùïé` as a function and its right argument `ùï©` as an argument. With a list of functions, we can make a table of the square and square root of a few numbers:

        ‚ü®√óÀú,‚àö‚ü© {ùïéùï©}‚åú 1‚Äø4‚Äø9
    ‚îå
      1 16 81
      1  2  3
              ‚îò

BQN's built-in operations also have patterns to indicate the syntactic role: modifiers (`` Àú¬®Àò‚Åº‚åú¬¥` ``) are all superscript characters, and compositions (`‚àò‚óã‚ä∏‚üú‚åæ‚äò‚ó∂‚öá‚éâ‚çü`) all have an unbroken circle (two functions `‚åΩ‚çâ` have broken circles with lines through them). Every other built-in constant is a function, although the special symbols `¬Ø`, `‚àû`, and `œÄ` are used as part of numeric literal notation.

### Modifiers and compositions

*Combinators* only control the application of functions. Because a non-function operand applies as a constant function, some combinators have extra meanings when passed a constant. For example, `0Àú` is the constant function that always returns 0 and `0‚ä∏<` is the function that tests whether its right argument is greater than 0.

Glyph | Name(s)     | Definition                     | Description
------|-------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------
`Àú`   | Self/Swap   | `{ùï©ùîΩùï®‚ä£ùï©}`                      | Duplicate one argument or exchange two
`‚àò`   | Atop        | `{ùîΩùï®ùîæùï©}`                       | Apply `ùîæ` to both arguments and `ùîΩ` to the result
`‚óã`   | Over        | `{(ùîæùï®)ùîΩùîæùï©}`                    | Apply `ùîæ` to each argument and `ùîΩ` to the results
`‚ä∏`   | Before/Bind | `{(ùîΩùï®‚ä£ùï©)ùîæùï©}`                   | `ùîæ`'s left argument comes from `ùîΩ`
`‚üú`   | After/Bind  | `{(ùï®‚ä£ùï©)ùîΩùîæùï©}`                   | `ùîΩ`'s right argument comes from `ùîæ`
`‚åæ`   | Under       | `{ùîæ‚Åº‚àòùîΩ‚óãùîæ}` OR `{(ùîæùï©)‚Ü©ùï®ùîΩ‚óãùîæùï©‚ãÑùï©}` | Apply `ùîΩ` over `ùîæ`, then undo `ùîæ`
`‚äò`   | Valences    | `{ùîΩùï©;ùï®ùîæùï©}`                     | Apply `ùîΩ` if there's one argument but `ùîæ` if there are two
`‚ó∂`   | Choose      | `{f‚Üê(ùï®ùîΩùï©)‚äëùïò ‚ãÑ ùï®Fùï©}`            | Select one of the functions in list `ùïò` based on `ùîΩ`

Choose isn't really a combinator since it calls the function `‚äë`, and Under is not a true combinator since it has an "undo" step at the end. This step might be implemented using the left operand's inverse (*computational* Under) or its structural properties (*structural* Under).

Other modifiers and compositions control array traversal and iteration. In three cases a simpler modifier is paired with a generalized composition: in each case the modifier happens to be the same as the composition with a right operand of `¬Ø1`.

Modifier | Name    | Compositon | Name
---------|---------|------------|--------
`Àò`      | Cells   | `‚éâ`        | Rank
`¬®`      | Each    | `‚öá`        | Depth
`‚åú`      | Table   |
`‚Åº`      | Undo    | `‚çü`        | Repeat
`¬¥`      | Reduce  |
`` ` ``  | Scan    |

## Literal notation

### Constant notation

BQN has single-token notation for numbers, strings, and characters.

Numbers allow the typical decimal notation with `¬Ø` for the negative sign (because `-` is a function) and `e` for scientific notation (or `E`, as numeric notation is case-insensitive). `‚àû` and `œÄ` may be used as special numeric values. Complex numbers are also allowed, with the components separated by `i`.

Strings are written with double quotes `""`, and characters with single quotes `''` with a single character in between. A double quote within a string can be escaped by writing it twice. If two string or two character literals are next to each other, they must be separated by a space.

### Separators

The characters `‚ãÑ` and `,` and newline are completely interchangeable and are used to separate expressions. An expression might be an element in a list or a line in a function. Empty sections‚Äîthose that consist only of whitespace‚Äîare ignored. This means that any number of separators can be used between expressions, and that leading and trailing separators are also allowed. The expressions are evaluated in text order: left to right and top to bottom.

### List notation

Lists (1-dimensional arrays) are enclosed in angle brackets `‚ü®‚ü©`, with the results of the expressions in between being the list's elements. Lists of two elements or more can also be written with the ligature character `‚Äø`. This character has higher binding strength than any part of an expression. If one of the elements is a compound expression, then it will need to be enclosed in parentheses.

If added, [sets and dictionaries](#sets-and-dictionaries) would also use a list-like notation.

### Explicit functions

Functions, modifiers, and combinators can be defined using curly braces `{}`. The contents are simply a sequence of expressions, where each is evaluated and the result of the last is returned. This result can have any value, and its syntactic role in the calling context is determined by the normal rules: functions return values and modifiers and compositions return functions. Operations defined in this way have lexical scope.

The special values `ùï®` and `ùï©`, which stand for arguments, and `ùïó` and `ùïò`, which stand for operands, are available inside curly braces. Like ordinary names, the lowercase forms indicate values and the uppercase forms `ùïéùïèùîΩùîæ` indicate functions. The type (including syntactic role) of the result is determined by its contents: a composition contains `ùïò`, a modifier contains `ùïó` but not `ùïò`, and a function contains neither.

A modifier or composition can be evaluated twice: once when passed operands and again when the resulting function is passed arguments. If it contains `ùï®` or `ùï©`, the first evaluation simply remembers the operands, and the contents will be executed only on the second evaluation, when the arguments are available. If it doesn't contain these, then the contents are executed on the first evaluation and the result is treated as a function.

## Data types

BQN will initially support the following fundamental types:

- Number (complex with 64-bit float precision)
- Character (Unicode code point)
- Array
- Function
- Modifier
- Composition

All of these types are immutable, and immutable types should be the default for BQN. The only mutable type likely to be added is the namespace or scope.

## BQN extensions

The above text describes the initial implementation target. The language will probably be extended after this target is reached. This section describes features which are not fully defined but could be added to the language.

### Sets and dictionaries

Sets are unordered collections of distinct values. Dictionaries have a set of keys and associate each key with a corresponding value. These types are a natural fit for the data in some cases; while they can be represented using arrays of keys and values, using the right type can lead to cleaner and faster algorithms.

The following glyphs are added for the dictionary and set literal notation.

Glyph(s)        | Meaning
----------------|-----------
`:`             | Key/value separator for dictionaries
`‚¶É‚¶Ñ`            | Set

Set notation matches the bracketed list notation with the angle brackets changed to double-struck curly brackets `‚¶É‚¶Ñ`, but there is no ligature notation for sets.

Dictionaries use angle brackets `‚ü®‚ü©` like lists, but instead of expressions there are pairs of expressions separated by `:`. The first expression evaluates to the key and the second to the corresponding value. The empty dictionary is written `‚ü®:‚ü©`.

Dictionaries and sets should be supported their own set of primitive operations like arrays are. The glyphs `‚à™‚äÇ‚äÉ‚äÜ‚äá` from mathematics are unused for this reason: they could be wanted for set operations.

### Namespaces and symbols

Sometimes it is useful to have a mutable type, particularly if a part of the program should maintain its own state over the course of execution. The [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) required as part of a complete lexical scoping implementation actually allow something like this. If a function defines and returns an explicit function, then that function can read and change variables in its environment. As the environment includes the scope created to execute the outer function, calling the outer function creates a mutable environment that can be indirectly accessed through the returned function.

A namespace would allow such an environment to be directly accessed and manipulated. While it's possible there would be facilities to create a namespace, a simpler mechanism is simply to add a primitive that returns the current scope as a variable. This scope would then behave the same way as a returned function's environment, and would allow member access by a dot-like syntax.

A symbol is a variable representing a name in the program. Symbols would make it easier to interact with namespaces dynamically.
