# BQN: finally, an APL for your flying saucer

*This repository does not yet have a working implementation. You can try a prototype implementation [online here](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN2NGN/web/index.html) (from [this repository](https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN2NGN))*

**BQN** is a new programming language in the APL lineage, which aims to remove inconsistent and burdensome aspects of the APL tradition and put the great ideas on a firmer footing. BQN is aimed at existing and aspiring APL-family programmers, and using it requires a solid understanding of functions and multidimensional arrays.

BQN maintains many of the ideas that made APL\360 revolutionary in 1966:
* Human-friendly **infix notation** with no precedence rules to remember.
* **Built-in array operations** handle any number of dimensions easily.
* **Higher-order functions** allow basic functions to be applied in more powerful ways.
It incorporates concepts developed over years of APL practice:
* The **leading axis model**, which allows for simpler built-in functions.
* Trains and combinators for **tacit programming**.
* Lightweight **anonymous functions** (like [dfns](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dfn)).
But BQN is redesigned from the ground up, with brand new ideas to make these paradigms easier to use and less likely to fail.
* The **based array model** makes non-arrays a fundamental part of the language, and removes the surprise of floating arrays and the hassle of explicit boxes. New **array notation** eliminates the gotchas of [stranding](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Strand_notation).
* A **context-free grammar** where a value's syntactic role is determined by its spelling makes it easier for machines and humans to understand code.
* Oh, and it naturally leads to **first-class functions**, a feature often missed in APL.
* The **new symbols** for built-in functionality allow the syntactic role of a primitive to be distinguished at a glance, and aim to be more consistent and intuitive.

## What does BQN look like?

It looks like qebrus okay:

    ‚äë+`‚àò‚åΩ‚çü12‚Üï2  ‚çù The 12th Fibonacci number

## Syntax

Like APL, BQN values have one of four *syntactic classes*:
* **Values**, like APL arrays or J nouns
* **Functions**, or verbs in J
* **Modifiers**, like APL monadic operators or J adverbs
* **Combinators**, like APL dyadic operators or J conjunctions.

These classes work exactly like they do in APL, with functions applying to one or two arguments, modifiers taking a single function or value on the left, and combinators taking a function or value on each side.

Unlike APL, in BQN the syntactic class of a value is determined purely by the way it's spelled: a lowercase first letter (`name`) makes it a value, an uppercase first letter (`Name`) makes it a function, and underscores are used for modifiers (`_name`) and combinators (`_name_`). Below, the function `{ùïéùï©}` treats its left argument `ùïé` as a function and its right argument `ùï©` as an argument. With a list of functions, we can make a table of the square and square root of a few numbers:

        ‚ü®√óÀú,‚àö‚ü© {ùïéùï©}‚åú 1‚Äø4‚Äø9
    ‚îå
      1 16 81
      1  2  3
              ‚îò
