# BQN documentation

Here is the documentation for BQN, describing what features BQN has, how to use them (with examples), and why they were chosen. As it is considerably more in-depth than the [specification](../spec/README.md), the documentation is much less complete. The following pages are present now:

Concepts:
- [Context-free grammar](context.md)
- [Functional programming](functional.md)
- [Array indices](indices.md)

Primitives:
- [Array depth](depth.md) (`≡` and `⚇`)
- [Group](group.md) (`⊔`)
- [Join](join.md) (`∾`)
- [Logical functions](logic.md) (`∧∨¬`)
- [Transpose](transpose.md) (`⍉`)
- [Windows](windows.md) (`↕`)
